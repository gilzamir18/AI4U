# AI4U - Artificial Inteligence For You

AI4U tool AI4U is a agent framework for modeling virtual reality and game environment. This repo we keep the reference implementation for Godot Game Engine.

The Godot version of the AI4U get advantage of the Godot architecture and facilitate agent specification by means of an agent abstraction. In Godot, AI4U provides a alternative approach to modeling Non-Player Characters (NPC). Although, developers can apply this tool in others situations, for example, the modeling environment for artificial intelligence experiments.

Agent abstraction defines an agent living in a environment and interacting with this environment by means of sensors and actuators. So, NPC specification is a kind of agent specification. Agent's components are: sensors, actuators, events, reward functions and brain. Sensors and actuators are the interface between agents and environments. A sensor provides data to an agent's brain, while actuators send actions from agent to environment. A brain is a script that proccessing sensors' data e made a decision (selects an action by time).

# BeMaker
AI4U Godot supports gymnasium environment in Python throught [bemaker tool](https://github.com/gilzamir18/bemaker). 

# Requirements

* Godot 4 Mono Version (tested only in Godot 4.1.1 stable, mono version, Windows 11)
* Python 3.10
* Gynasium

How To Contribute
To any interested in making the AI4U better, there is still some documentation that needs to be done. If you want to contribute, please read CONTRIBUTING.md guide first.
