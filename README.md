# What is AI4U?
AI4U is a backbone infrastructure for various flavors of AI4U. AI4U is separated into several subprojects. AI4U is the foundation on which many other projects are built on powerfull game engines (Unity and Godot). AI4U role is to connect third-party applications to Unity/Godot through the Python language and providing an agent abstraction.
