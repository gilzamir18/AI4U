# What is AI4U?
AI4U is a multi-engine plugin (Godot and Unity) that allows you designing Non-Player Characters (NPCs) of games using a agent abstraction. In addition, AI4U has a low-level API that allows you to connect the agent to any algorithm made available in Python by the reinforcement learning community specifically and by the Articial Intelligence community in general. Reiforcement learning promises overcome tradicional navigation mesh mechanism in games and to provide more autonomous characters.

# News
AI4U is in alpha stage. We are refactoring it for a more flexible and robust API. First, let's refactor the Unity version of this API and then the Godot version. If you want to help and speed up the development of this API, please contact me (gilzamir@outlook.com).

# Maintainers
AI4U is currently maintained by Gilzamir Gomes (gilzamir@ufc.alu.br), Creto A. Vidal (cvidal@dc.ufc.br), Joaquim B. Cavalcante-Neto (joaquimb@dc.ufc.br) and Yuri Nogueira (yuri@dc.ufc.br).

## Important Note: We do not do technical support, nor consulting and don't answer personal questions per email.

#How To Contribute
To any interested in making the AI4U better, there is still some documentation that needs to be done. If you want to contribute, please read CONTRIBUTING.md guide first.

# Acknowledgments
AI4U was created in the CRab (Computer Graphics, Virtual Reality and Animations) Labs at UFC (Universidade Federal do Cear√°).
