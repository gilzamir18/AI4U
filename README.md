# What is AI4U Connect?
AI4U Connect is the backbone infrastructure for various flavors of AI4U. AI4U is separated into several subprojects. The AI4USB3 project, for example, is a full integration with the stable-baselines3 framework. AI4U Connect is the foundation on which many other projects are built.

AI4U Connect's role is to connect third-party applications to Unity through the Python language and providing an agent abstraction.

Also, AI4U supports Godot and Unity. We are currently focused on refactoring an old, clunky API into a more robust simplified version to work smoothly with Unity. Then we will implement this new version in Godot.

# Warning
Currently, AI4U Connect is under intense development. The API is not yet stable. We hope to soon stabilize the API.

# Maintainers
AI4U is currently maintained by Gilzamir Gomes (gilzamir@ufc.alu.br), Creto A. Vidal (cvidal@dc.ufc.br), Joaquim B. Cavalcante-Neto (joaquimb@dc.ufc.br) and Yuri Nogueira (yuri@dc.ufc.br).

## Important Note: We do not do technical support, nor consulting and don't answer personal questions per email.

#How To Contribute
To any interested in making the AI4U better, there is still some documentation that needs to be done. If you want to contribute, please read CONTRIBUTING.md guide first.
