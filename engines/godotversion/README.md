# AI4U Godot Edition

This is the Godot version of the AI4U tool (AI4U Godot Edition - AI4UGE). The Godot version of the AI4U get advantage of the Godot architecture and facilitate agent specification by means of an agent abstraction. In Godot, AI4U provides a alternative approach to modeling Non-Player Characters (NPC). Although, developers can apply this tool in others situations, for example, the modeling environment for artificial intelligence experiments.

Agent abstraction defines an agent living in a environment and interacting with this environment by means of sensors and actuators. So, NPC specification is a kind of agent specification. Agent's components are: sensors, actuators, events, reward functions and brain. Sensors and actuators are the interface between agents and environments. A sensor provides data to an agent's brain, while actuators send actions from agent to environment. A brain is a script that proccessing sensors' data e made a decision (selects an action by time).
